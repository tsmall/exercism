#+TITLE: L.B. Stanza

This directory contains solutions to problems written in L.B. Stanza.
This isn't a real Exercism track;
I'm implementing both the tests and solutions to other problems.
But I think Stanza is a fascinating language
and I wanted some problems to try it on.

* Working on exercises

Unfortunately I don't know of any editors with Stanza support.
(Maybe I'll create one.)
So just use your editor of choice.

Stanza is a compiled language.
So your work pattern will follow the typical
edit, compile, and run pattern.

* Running tests

Each exercise has a ~Makefile~
set up to build and run the tests.
To run the tests navigate to the exercise directory
and run:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ make
#+END_EXAMPLE
