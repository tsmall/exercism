#+TITLE: Pharo Smalltalk

This directory contains solutions to problems written in [[http://pharo.org][Pharo]].
This isn't a real Exercism track;
I'm implementing both the tests and solutions as I go.
Smalltalk is a fascinating language and environment.

* Working on exercises

I'm "filing out" the tests and solutions to the problems.
But Pharo is an immersive, image-based environment.
So the files are just to have a record in my Git repo.

You can "file in" the test and solution objects into your own Pharo image
to run them.

* Running tests

After importing the objects,
navigate to the test classes
and click the icon next to the class name
to run all the tests.
(You can also click the icon next to an individual test method
to run only that test.)
