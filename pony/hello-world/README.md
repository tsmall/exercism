# Hello World

The classical introductory exercise.
Just say "Hello, World!".

["Hello, World!"][WP] is the traditional first program
for beginning programming in a new language or environment.

The objectives are simple:

- Write a function that returns the string "Hello, World!".
- Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.
- Submit your solution and check it at the website.

If everything goes well, you will be ready to fetch your first real exercise.

## Running The Tests

Since Pony is a static, compiled language,
you need to compile the program first.
The tests are defined in the `Main` actor,
so compiling and running the program runs the tests.

```
$ ponyc .
$ ./hello-world
```

## Source

This is so common it's hard to know where it really came from.

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution
so you can see how others have completed the exercise.
