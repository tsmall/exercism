#+TITLE: Perl 6

This directory contains the solutions to my Perl 6 problems.
I chose to tackle this track because Perl 6 is a fascinating language.
Many smart people spent a long time designing and building it,
trying to come up with a language that will last long into the future.
The Perl community has always been interesting to me,
with its focus on linguistics and writing.
Perl 6, as the evolution of that, is very intriguing.

See the [[http://exercism.io/languages/perl6/about][Exercism Perl 6 page]] for details about this track.

* Working on exercises

Perl 6 supports an interactive shell,
which is useful for testing small snippets of code.
But I'm essentially following the typical edit, compile, run pattern
while working on these exercises.

* Running tests

Each problem's readme file explains this in more detail,
but the essence is this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ prove . --exec=perl6
#+END_EXAMPLE
