# Two Fer

`Two-fer` or `2-fer` is short for two for one. One for you and one for me.

```text
"One for X, one for me."
```

When X is a name or "you".

If the given name is "Alice", the result should be "One for Alice, one for me."
If no name is given, the result should be "One for you, one for me."


## Resources

Remember to check out the Perl 6 [documentation](https://docs.perl6.org/) and
[resources](https://perl6.org/resources/) pages for information, tips, and
examples if you get stuck.

## Running the tests

There is a test suite and module included with the exercise.
The test suite (a file with the extension `.t`) will attempt to run routines
from the module (a file with the extension `.pm6`).
Add/modify routines in the module so that the tests will pass! You can view the
test data by executing the command `perl6 --doc *.t` (\* being the name of the
test suite), and run the test suite for the exercise by executing the command
`prove . --exec=perl6` in the exercise directory.
You can also add the `-v` flag e.g. `prove . --exec=perl6 -v` to display all
tests, including any optional tests marked as 'TODO'.
